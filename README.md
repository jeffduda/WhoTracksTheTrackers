# WhoTracksTheTrackers
A survey of fiber tractography software with practical examples. Here we will
attempt to identify a variety of open-source fiber tractography software tools
and provide examples of how to use these packages on a common dataset. When
possible, we attempt to provide a full chain of commands that takes the data
from dicom to connectivity matrix.
