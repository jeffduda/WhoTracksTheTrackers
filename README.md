# WhoTracksTheTrackers
A survey of fiber tractography [1] software with practical examples. Here we will
attempt to identify a variety of open-source fiber tractography software tools
and provide examples of how to use these packages on a common dataset. When
possible, we attempt to provide a full chain of commands that takes the data
from dicom to connectivity matrix.

# The Helpers
Others tools that we will use

# The Process
We will attempt to use each package to accomplish the following general steps:

1. Preprocessing
  * Motion correction
  * Distortion correction
  * Tensor reconstruction
  * Scalar metric calculation (mean diffusion, fractional anisotropy, etc)
2. Whole brain tracking
  * Deterministic
  * Probabilistic
3. Connectivity matrix calculation
  * Region labeling
  * Connection counting
  * Connection metrics (mean FA, etc)
